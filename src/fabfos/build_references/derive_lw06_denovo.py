"""LW06's de-novo GPR, from BW25113's, by withholding the genes its genotype broke.

    PATH="/home/tony/lib/miniforge3/envs/msm-fabfos/bin:$PATH" \\
        python src/fabfos/build_references/derive_lw06_denovo.py [--publish]

LW06 has no submitted genome sequence, which is why the GEM side registers it as a borrow
in `host_gpr_gem.py` and why the de-novo side has to borrow here: B2 emits one table per
proteome, and that step runs on a compute node over mapper outputs and knows nothing about
strains. This is `derive_ag1_denovo.py` for a different pair, and deliberately the same
shape -- AG1 borrows DH1, LW06 borrows BW25113.

BW25113 ITSELF WITHHOLDS NOTHING, and that is worth stating rather than leaving as an
absent function. GCF_050858555.1 is BW25113's own sequence, so its proteome already lacks
what the strain lacks: `lacZ`, `araB` and `rhaB` return no record, exactly as the Keio
parent's genotype says they should. The only BW25113 marker still present as a protein is
`recA`, which the tolerance study deletes -- and recA nominates no metabolic reaction, so
withholding it would change nothing and asserting it here would imply it might.

A WITHHELD ROW, NOT A DROPPED REACTION. The GEM edit list names reactions because a curated
model's unit is a reaction; a de-novo table's unit is an ORF. LW06 lacks the *proteins*
ldhA, ackA, frdABCD and adhE, so what it lacks is those ORFs' rows, and whatever else still
nominates a reaction keeps nominating it. Dropping by MNXR instead would strip reactions
that intact genes still support -- which is the same distinction that makes `ACKr` survive
on purT/tdcD in the curated channel.

THE ENGINEERED INSERTION IS NOT ADDED HERE. pdcZm and adhBZm are Zymomonas genes on a Tn7
insertion and appear in no E. coli proteome; they ride as study GPR rows
(`data/fabfos/runs/scales/gpr/gpr_insertion.parquet`) that concatenate at solve time. This
file only subtracts, like every other host step.

The genotype is imported from `check_lw06_identity.py` rather than restated: that file
measures which markers the MODEL can see, this one applies the same markers to the lanes,
and two copies of a genotype is how they come to disagree.
