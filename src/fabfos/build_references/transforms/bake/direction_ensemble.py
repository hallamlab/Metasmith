# The direction assembly: calibrate the curated bins, fuse the members, encode the ratios.
#
# WHAT IS HERE AND WHAT IS NOT. The two thermodynamic members are lanes of their own
# (`equilibrator.py`, `dgbyg.py`); the curated member is read here, from the drop-in, the
# same way `aam_ensemble` reads the other .dat.
#
# IT INSTANTIATES NO MEMBER. `dir_calibrate` imports `dir_thermo_eq` at module level, but
# that module imports `equilibrator_api` inside `EquilibratorMember.__init__`, and the
# calibration reads the member table rather than instantiating it. `dir_quotient annotate`
# does need rdkit, because the substitution table it restages through admits its models by
# parsing SMILES -- rdkit is in this image, which is the other reason the lane is grouped by
# it.
#
# WHAT THAT BUYS IS AN OFFLINE RE-FIT. `curated`, `calibrate` and `combine` are pure pandas
# over artifacts already on disk, so `benchmarks/direction_rescue/reassemble.py` re-runs them
# in seconds and reproduces the deployed annotation frame-for-frame, taking the correction
# table as an input rather than recomputing it. That is what makes the arms of a re-bake --
# balance gate, prior width, quotient, prior scale, constants -- separable offline instead of
# confounded in one run.
#
# THE CURATED CALL IS THE LOAD-BEARING STEP, not a formality. REACTION-DIRECTION is stated
# in MetaCyc's equation orientation and MNXref re-canonicalises orientation on import, so a
# naive metacyc->MNXR join INVERTS the curated call on ~60% of reactions. `dir_curated`
# re-expresses every call by comparing compound sets, and records the undecidable ones
# rather than guessing.
#
# CALIBRATION READS THE MEMBER TABLE rather than re-instantiating the member and re-scoring
# every curated reaction. That was about half this lane's wall clock, spent recomputing
# numbers the member had already written down.
#
# IT CALIBRATES ON THE MEASURED ARM ONLY. eQuilibrator's group-contribution arm returns
# identically zero for group-conserving chemistry, which is exactly what dominates the
# REVERSIBLE bin -- including it manufactures a fictitiously tight zero-centred bin and
# then reports high confidence in it.
#
# AN ABSENT MEMBER IS A MISSING VOTE HERE, and this is the one place in the lane where that
# is true. Each member lane refuses if its own tool is unavailable, because a lane's only
# product is its member table. The combiner is different: it is defined over whatever
# members spoke, and `dir_combine` already treats an empty table as silence. No evidence
# shrinks toward dG'=0, giving ratio 1.0 -- reversible as a LIMIT rather than as an
# if-branch -- so a reaction the ensemble is silent on is a provable no-op.
#
# THE TWO THERMODYNAMIC MEMBERS ARE CORRELATED, both fitted on TECRDB, so their agreement
# is discounted by a shared-error floor rather than counted twice. MetaCyc is the only
# independent member, which is why losing the licensed drop-in does not shrink this
# ensemble evenly -- it removes the only thing that can break a tie between two members
# that were always going to agree.
#
# IT STOPS AT THE UNCODED TABLE. This step used to encode its own output, which bought one
# fewer step at the price of requiring `ref::metabolism_vocab` -- and so of waiting on the
# whole atom-mapping branch. The vocabulary was never an input to the science: the encoder
# touches exactly one of its five spaces, `rxn`, and that space is `sorted(universe)` read
# off MetaNetX `reac_prop`, not anything a mapper produces. So the edge was real but sat in
# the wrong place, wrapping a few minutes of encoding around a multi-hour assembly. It moves
# to `direction_bake.py`, and this lane runs the moment the two members are in. The identity
# guarantee is unaffected: it was always enforced inside `bake_metabolism`, which reads the
# block off the vocabulary and has no path that could mint a second one.
