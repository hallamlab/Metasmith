# BioNumbers -- the quantities metabolomics does not measure.
#
# ONE COMPOUND, AND IT IS WORTH A TRANSFORM. Under the measured-E.-coli rule this source
# contributes dissolved O2 and nothing else: every CO2 record BioNumbers holds is a
# solubility in water at a stated partial pressure with organism `Generic`, which is an
# extracellular equilibrium rather than a cytoplasmic pool. But O2 appears in 10,378
# in-graph reactions -- the third most common participant in the universe after water and
# the proton, both of which eQuilibrator's prime potentials already handle -- and no
# metabolomics database measures it, because mass spectrometry of a cell extract does not
# see a dissolved gas. ECMDB carries 1,186 measurements and not one is a gas.
#
# THERE IS NO BULK DOWNLOAD AND NO API, so the acquisition is a search plus the record pages
# for the BNIDs the bake actually reads. Both are kept: the search response is what makes
# the SELECTION checkable (a reader can see what else was there and was refused), and the
# record pages are what make each VALUE checkable against its own source.
#
# WHICH RECORDS ARE READ IS NOT DECIDED HERE. `sources/bionumbers.tsv` names them and
# `sources/bionumbers_rejected.tsv` records every refusal with its reason. This transform
# fetches; the adapter selects.
