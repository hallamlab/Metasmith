# ECMDB 2.0 -- the E. coli metabolome, acquired as a file plus a scrape.
#
# TWO PRODUCTS, AND NEITHER SUBSTITUTES FOR THE OTHER. `ecmdb.json.zip` is 3,760 metabolite
# cards carrying kegg/chebi/hmdb/m2m identifiers and structures, and it holds NO
# concentrations at all. The measurements live only in a paginated HTML browse with no API
# behind it. So the crosswalk is downloaded and the data is scraped, by
# `buildlib::ecmdb_scrape.py`.
#
# THE ZIP IS NOT UNPACKED, on this tier's standing rule -- the same reason chebi keeps its
# `.tsv.gz` gzipped and kofam keeps its tarball tarred. Unpacking is the processed tier's
# work.
#
# ECMDB PUBLISHES NO RELEASE ENDPOINT, so `RELEASE` is the version the site states for its
# current build. That is the weakest of the pin shapes in fabfos_data.yml -- weaker than
# MetaNetX's frozen tree, comparable to KEGG's quarterly number over a rolling endpoint --
# which is why the scrape's own row and metabolite counts are printed and floored rather
# than assumed. A silently-shortened browse is the failure this cannot afford: it would
# drop metabolites from the concentration table and every reaction touching them would
# quietly fall back to the 1 mM default.
