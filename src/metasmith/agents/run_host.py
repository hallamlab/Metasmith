"""Shell functions that answer questions about a run on the host that launched it.

A cluster's login nodes share the filesystem but not their process tables, and an
ssh to the cluster lands on whichever node round-robin DNS picks. A pid in
PID.lock or RUN.pgid only means something on the node in RUN.host, so every
liveness check, kill and scan goes there. A run whose driver is a Slurm job also
has RUN.slurmjob, which answers when that node cannot be reached.
