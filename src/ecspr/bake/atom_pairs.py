"""Atom-transfer PAIRS from cached atom-mapping output: which metabolite's atoms
land in which metabolite, per element.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The bipartite met-rxn graph the solve runs on is a STAR: a reaction is a node joined
to every metabolite it touches. Eliminating that node -- which is exactly what the
Woodbury update's `_build_delta` does -- leaves a CLIQUE over every participant, so
every pair of participants gets conductance whether or not one atom passes between
them. The edge weights are atom counts, so the method looks stoichiometry-aware; the
TOPOLOGY throws the atom mapping away.

Measured on the real carbon graph: 52.8% of the reaction-induced metabolite pairs
transfer no atoms at all. On MNXR106432 (acetyl-CoA + CO2 + NADPH = pyruvate + NADP+
+ CoA) the pyruvate-NADPH channel carries ZERO carbons at conductance 0.700, while
the real one-carbon pyruvate-CO2 channel gets 0.033 -- a zero-atom channel 21x more
conductive than a real one.

The information needed to fix it already exists and is already computed. The unifier
(`20b_aam_unify.py:count_transits`) holds the substrate metabolite and the product
metabolite of each mapped atom IN THE SAME LOOP ITERATION, and then discards the
pairing into two independent role counters:

    sm = sub_mnxms[si]                       # substrate MNXM   <- the pair
    pm = prod_mnxms[j]                       # product MNXM     <- is right here
    if sm: counts[el][f"{sm}:substrate"] += 1     # and then thrown
    if pm: counts[el][f"{pm}:product"]   += 1     # away, separately

This module keeps `(sm, pm)`. Everything else is the same computation.

RE-EXTRACTION, NOT RE-MAPPING. The mapped SMILES are cached with their atom-map
numbers; nothing here runs RXNMapper or LocalMapper. This is arithmetic over a cache.

WHY A METABOLITE-LEVEL PAIR IS STILL NOT ENOUGH
-----------------------------------------------
Worth stating because it is the trap this whole design walks around. Pairing at the
METABOLITE level does not fix the stated problem. The true atom map splits
acetyl-CoA's 23 carbons by destination: atoms [0,1] -- the acetyl group -- become
pyruvate; the other 21 -- the CoA moiety -- become CoA. So acetyl-CoA -> CoA is a
GENUINE 21-carbon edge that any metabolite-level graph keeps, and a path arriving on
acetyl carbons could still leave through the CoA moiety carrying 21 carbons it never
brought. Only atom-resolved nodes deny that, which is why this module emits the atom
INDICES and not merely the counts -- the indices are what the class refinement
downstream partitions on.

WHAT IS REFUSED, AND WHY -- AND THE TWO REFUSALS THAT WERE BUGS
---------------------------------------------------------------
This module's first version refused 40% of the mapper universe and reported that as a
coverage finding about the method's reach. It was not. Two of the three refusals were
defects in THIS FILE, and they cost the atom lane 29 of the curated set4 axes:

  * `stripped` (19,930 rxns, 34.6%) was a REGEX MISMATCH, not unbalanced chemistry.
    The story told here -- "generic metabolites with no SMILES were dropped before
    mapping, so the mapper re-routed their atoms" -- describes a real phenomenon in a
    DIFFERENT file (`aam_stripped_input.tsv`), which this module never reads and which
    is disjoint from the universe it does read. The real cause: `EQ_TERM` matched
    `WATER`/`BIOMASS`, which the SMILES builder's regex does not, so the metabolite
    count exceeded the template count and every water-bearing reaction was refused.
    See `EQ_TERM`. Measured: 30,938 of 30,939 metabolites in the universe HAVE a
    canonical SMILES -- nothing was dropped for lack of structure.
  * `ambiguous_duplicate` (3,255 rxns) was 98.7% SELF-INFLICTED: the same metabolite
    twice is not an ambiguity. See `match_mols`. Only 43 were real.
  * DUPLICATE-METABOLITE reactions where two DISTINCT MNXMs share one canonical SMILES
    are genuinely ambiguous -- `pop(0)` picks between different metabolites -- and stay
    refused. That refusal is real.
  * `stripped` AGAIN, on a second and much smaller regex-shaped fault: a MULTI-COMPONENT
    participant. MetaNetX writes a salt or an ion pair as ONE metabolite with one
    `.`-joined SMILES -- ammonium hydroxide is `[NH4+].[OH-]` -- and the submission
    builder joins participants with `.` too, so that metabolite reaches the mapper as two
    components and comes back as two templates. The count of templates then exceeds the
    count of participants and the whole reaction is refused, on all three members at once,
    which is the tell: three independent mappers do not agree about chemistry, they agree
    about arithmetic. 248 of the universe's participants are multi-component and they sit
    in 567 reactions. See `coalesce_components`, which merges the components back BEFORE
    the alignment check and is a no-op everywhere else.
  * A REUSED ATOM-MAP NUMBER is refused per atom (`duplicate_map_numbers`). An atom map
    is a bijection, so a number may appear at most once per side. The product loop reads
    each product atom's number out of `sub_index`, so a number repeated on the product
    side pairs one substrate atom with two product atoms, in two different molecules when
    the repeats sit in different templates. Indigo does this on 56% of what it maps: on
    MNXR166070 it labels the ATP ribose with L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate's numbers and leaves
    ADP's own ribose unmapped, which put five sugar carbons into ATP at half weight and
    gave the fusion a decoy to dilute against. This refusal came AFTER two generations of
    the bake shipped without it, and it is the one refusal here that is arithmetic rather
    than chemistry -- nothing outside the mapped string is consulted.

The lesson worth keeping: a refusal rate is not evidence about the world until the
refusals have been read. It kept being worth keeping: the multi-component refusal above
was found four generations later, in the same status column, by reading it again.
`mapped_nothing` had been carried as a chemistry residual across three re-bakes and an
LLM curation panel; 285 of its 571 reactions are compartment transport with nothing to
transfer, and most of the rest were this. Reporting 37.8% coverage as a property of the atom mapping,
when most of it was this file disagreeing with a regex, put a false limitation into a
report and nearly retired a set of biologically real axes. Every status here is
counted and reported so the next reader can check rather than believe.
