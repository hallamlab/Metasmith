"""T4: fuse the three members into one directional ratio per base-graph reaction.

The combiner is a weighted vote in dG' space (the functional-lane belief pattern,
continuous analogue): each member votes weighted by its own precision, and the
result is damped toward zero by total evidence -- so a reaction no member speaks
to lands at ratio 1.0 (reversible) as a LIMIT of the single rule, not an if-branch.

Two fusions, because the correlation structure differs:
  * eQuilibrator and dGbyG are both TECRDB-fitted -> correlated. They are fused
    into ONE thermo vote whose uncertainty is floored by TAU_SHARED (the common-
    mode TECRDB bias their spread is blind to) and by their own disagreement, so
    two correlated instruments cannot vote as two independent ones.
  * The curated member is TECRDB-independent physiology -> genuinely independent,
    so it fuses with the thermo vote by ordinary inverse-variance precision.

The category vote uses the T3 calibration (category -> empirical dG' on the
measured arm), never a direction classifier. Shrinkage is a decision rule, not a
third prior: lambda = SIGMA_0^2 / (SIGMA_0^2 + s_post^2) damps mu toward 0 in
proportion to how little evidence there is. The ratio is the median transform
exp(mu_eff/RT) (transform-equivariant; never E[ratio], which inflates).

Pure pandas -- runs in p312. Reads the two per-member parquets (eval_members.py),
the curated per-MNXR table (T2), and the calibration (T3).
