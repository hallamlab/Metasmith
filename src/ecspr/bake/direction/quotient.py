# The reaction quotient: what turns a standard-state dG'o into a physiological dG'.
#
# WHAT THIS FIXES. Every ratio the bake ships is exp(dG'o/RT) -- the standard state, every
# participant at one molar. No lane forms a Q term, so no row carries any information about
# intracellular concentration, and glycogen phosphorylase therefore ships as a glycogen
# SYNTHASE at dir_confidence 0.94. The thermodynamics were never wrong; the question they
# answered was not the one a conductance model asks.
#
# TWO COMMANDS.
#   `table`    aggregate the cited sources into one concentration and one width per MNXM.
#   `annotate` emit the per-MNXR correction, per member.
#
# IT LIVES AT THE COMBINER, NOT IN A MEMBER, and that placement is the whole design. Q is a
# function of (stoichiometry, concentrations) alone -- it does not know or care whether
# eQuilibrator or dGbyG produced the standard term. Putting it inside one member would make
# the two members incommensurable: one would be answering about a cell and the other about
# a beaker, and `thermo_vote` fuses them as though they answered the same question.
#
# BUT IT IS COMPUTED PER MEMBER ANYWAY, because the STOICHIOMETRY is per member. The
# substitution lane restages polymer equations, a row can be refused for one member and
# kept for the other, and applying a correction to MetaNetX's unsubstituted form of a
# polymer reaction is meaningless -- the two glucans cancel only once the substitution has
# put both of them there. So: one Q definition, evaluated on each member's own equation.
#
# THE DEFAULT IS 1 mM AND IT IS NEVER SKIPPED. A participant with no measurement left at
# the 1 M standard state while its partners move to millimolar makes the correction
# ONE-SIDED. Measured on MNXR145036 that returns -17.3 kJ/mol where the balanced answer is
# +5.4: [Pi] got its 5 mM, [G1P] got nothing, and a fifty-fold pool skew was invented out
# of an absence. A one-sided reaction quotient is worse than none.
#
# Standalone: `python -m ecspr.bake.direction.quotient annotate ...` (any env with pandas).
