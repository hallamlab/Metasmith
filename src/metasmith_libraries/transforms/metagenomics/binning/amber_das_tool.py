# amber.py fanned out over the shared binning::contig_to_bin_table supertype
# on purpose, so it scores metabat2, semibin2 and comebin alike. That same
# breadth is what makes it unreachable for DAS Tool's pooled table alone: DAS
# Tool's table also satisfies contig_to_bin_table, and lineage matching in
# this planner is ancestral, so a target pinned to "the amber slot descending
# from the pooled table" cannot be told apart from "descending from the raw
# tables the pooled table itself descends from" -- the slot stays ambiguous
# and the target is dropped rather than narrowed. Confirmed the hard way in
# research/cami/run_cami_metag.py's `build_targets`: pinning amber's existing
# table requirement to the DAS Tool table drops the target outright, and
# masking the other binners out of the library so only that table remains
# still fails, which is what shows amber cannot consume it through that
# requirement at all rather than merely preferring another producer.
# amber.py's own requirement is now narrower still (binning::
# raw_contig_to_bin_table, which das_tool_contig_to_bin_table deliberately
# does not extend -- see binning.yml), because the SAME ambiguity bites from
# the other side too: an unpinned amber.py could satisfy a per-binner AMBER
# target from DAS Tool's pooled table just as easily as from that binner's
# own, since the pool descends from every table it consolidates.
#
# This transform requires the CONCRETE das_tool_contig_to_bin_table instead of
# the shared supertype. Exactly one transform (das_tool.py) produces that
# type, so there is no ambiguity to resolve and a target naming this
# transform's own products needs no parent pin. Its products are their own
# distinct types (das_tool_amber_results / das_tool_amber_bin_metrics) rather
# than amber.py's amber_results / amber_bin_metrics, because two transforms
# producing one type is the other half of this trap -- see binning.yml.
#
# Everything below is amber.py's own protocol, unchanged.
