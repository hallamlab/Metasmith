# One `checkm_stats` per bin set, each parented to that set. The parent is what forks
# the fan-out: an unparented requirement is answered once, from whichever binner the
# planner likes, and the other two binners' bins reach no instance at all.
#
# CAUTION this transform used to carry a third requirement per bin set, `taxonomy::gtdbtk`,
# parented the same way. It was removed 2026-09-12 and the reasoning matters, because
# re-adding it re-opens a launch blocker rather than a cost:
#
#   1. The protocol never read it. Only `checkm_stats` selects a bin -- completeness and
#      contamination -- so the taxonomy content reached no output. The slots existed to
#      shape the plan, the way `getNcbiAssembly` requires a name it never opens.
#   2. Their original purpose is gone. They were here so `iphop_add_to_db` got taxonomy
#      covering every binner that can contribute to the pool. That consumer now requires
#      `taxonomy::gtdbtk_raw` instead -- add_to_db wants de_novo_wf's DECORATED TREES, and
#      the classification TSV `taxonomy::gtdbtk` carries is a different artifact it never
#      opens. So these three became vestigial when that split landed, and nothing in this
#      library consumed `taxonomy::gtdbtk` afterwards except this transform.
#   3. The fan-out does not depend on them. `checkm_stats` is parented to the same three
#      bin sets by the same mechanism, so the three-way fork survives their removal --
#      verified by bindings, not argued.
#   4. They made GTDB-Tk load-bearing for a chain that does not want it. gtdbtk requires
#      `ref::gtdb`, a ~100 GB reference, and its classify step is a 128 GB, multi-hour
#      task per batch. A failure there starved this transform silently, and with it the
#      whole quality-MAG chain: skani_dedup, derep_mag_reference and the published-MAG
#      recovery comparison -- all for output no consumer of this transform reads.
#
# A driver that genuinely wants per-bin taxonomy should target `taxonomy::gtdbtk`
# directly. It must not be forced through this transform, which discards it.
