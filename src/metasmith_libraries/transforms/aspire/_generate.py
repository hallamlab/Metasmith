"""The ASPIRE topology, in one table, and the generator that emits it.

`research/aspire/upstream/ASPIRE/asv_pipeline.nf` is 45 hand-wired Nextflow processes. This file
is the port of that wiring into a typed graph: `TABLE` has one row per ported
process, and running this module writes both `data_types/aspire.yml` and every
stub transform under `transforms/aspire/`.

The table stays the one source of topology and of `aspire.yml`, including for
transforms with real bodies. A file that begins with `BANNER` is a stub and is
rewritten on every run; a file without it is hand-written and is never touched.
A row edit therefore has to be mirrored by hand in a real body, and `--lint`
fails until the body's requirements, products and grouping match its row.

Three things the port does to the source pipeline, each recorded per row:

* **`.done` sentinels are not ported.** A sentinel stood for an artifact the
  next process re-opened by absolute path out of a shared staging directory. The
  artifact is what gets declared -- a named file where one was read, a directory
  where one was scanned.
* **Optional stages that have downstream consumers are gated on a policy
  token.** Nextflow expressed them by *rebinding* the channel its consumers
  read; there is no rebinding here, so instead two transforms produce the same
  consumer-facing type and each requires a different sibling token. The driver
  registers exactly one, so the losing arm has no candidates and is never
  instantiated. Purely terminal optional stages need no token: you get them by
  asking for their output.
* **Plot-only processes are folded into the transform that computed their
  tables** (see `folds=` on the rows).

Run it:

    python transforms/aspire/_generate.py            # write types + stubs
    python transforms/aspire/_generate.py --lint      # check subsumption and real bodies

`--lint` loads the compiled library, so run `dev/libraries.sh -bm` after a regenerate.
