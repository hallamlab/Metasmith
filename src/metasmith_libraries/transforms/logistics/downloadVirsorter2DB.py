# VirSorter2's own setup, driven from inside its own image -- and that image has no
# downloader. `virsorter setup` is a snakemake workflow whose download rules shell out
# to `wget`, which is absent here, as is curl. Every rule therefore failed with
# "wget: command not found" and snakemake reported it as a rule error rather than as a
# missing dependency. The shim below answers `wget` with python3, which the image does
# have, honouring the flags those rules actually pass.
#
# Two details of that shim are load-bearing. The rules read the command's OUTPUT for
# the string "404 Not Found" and fall back to a second mirror when they see it, so a
# failure has to exit non-zero rather than write a short file; and `--tries N` and
# `--timeout N` arrive as two tokens, so a naive "skip anything starting with -" parser
# consumes the URL as a flag argument.
