    # checked with a python walk over all 17 of its modules rather than with grep, because
    # grep inside that image returns zero matches even for `def ` and so cannot be trusted
    # there. The database's own version manifest does not name it either. The tmp paths the
    # tool DOES build at run time are `*.updated.mmseq_clu_tmp` under its own out_dir and
    # `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` scratch -- different names, different place.
    #
    # CAUTION this prune is a CORRECTNESS requirement, not housekeeping. A directory
    # product holding a dangling symlink cannot survive the standard task contract:
    # nextflow's unstage copies with `nxf_fs_copy`'s `cp -fRL`, `-L` dereferences, the copy
    # fails, and retry-then-ignore swallows it -- so the step reports complete with no
    # product and every consumer downstream silently drops out. The first fix attempted was
    # to turn `scratch` off for cached twins, which bends the execution environment for
    # every twin to work around one product's defect. The contract is fixed; the product is
    # what has to be made valid inside it.
    # Directories only: the release's macOS `._<name>.mmseq_tmp` files match the glob too.
