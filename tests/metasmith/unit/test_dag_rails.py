"""The rule a drawing has to keep: one drawn path per edge, and no other.

A run carries one node's output and may feed many children, and a bar
gathers every parent of one node, so lines are shared. The drawing stays
readable only if following it from a node's marker arrives at exactly that
node's children, each by one way. Every corner of a route is drawn as an arc
and is a connection; a line passing straight through a point where another
line crosses is not. That is checkable off the routes alone: walk the drawn
unit segments, go straight wherever a line continues, and turn only where
some route turns in that direction.
