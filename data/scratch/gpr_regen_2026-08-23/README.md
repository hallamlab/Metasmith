# Re-annotated from source — 2026-08-23

The 2026-08-18 regen re-ran the mapper over lane outputs that lived only on Sockeye. This
one re-ran **the lanes themselves**, so every host and the clone cohort now has an
`annotations/lanes/` in the tree that its de-novo table is actually built from. Eleven of
thirteen runs had a de-novo GPR table with nothing behind it here.

| run | site that won | rows | pbert | clean | matches 08-18 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `e_coli_k12` | sockeye | 31,338 | 6,898 | 20,032 | yes |
| `e_coli_dh10b` | sockeye | 31,246 | 6,788 | 20,033 | yes |
| `e_coli_epi300` | sockeye | 31,353 | 6,826 | 20,088 | yes |
| `e_coli_dh1` | **fir** | 30,722 | 6,751 | 19,566 | yes |
| `e_coli_bw25113` | sockeye | 30,838 | 6,761 | 19,679 | yes |
| `e_coli_w3110` | sockeye | 31,657 | 6,984 | 20,240 | yes |
| `eydallin_clones` | sockeye | 642 | 152 | 376 | yes |

Row-for-row agreement with the previous campaign is the evidence that re-running the
annotators measured the same thing rather than a new one. `e_coli_ag1` (30,711, DH1 minus
four loss alleles) and `e_coli_lw06` (30,598, BW25113 minus seven) derive from their
parents; `aska` and `scales` read AG1 and BW25113 in turn.

k12, dh10b and epi300 also lost the 2024 lane trees they had been carrying beside the new
ones — those keyed on `NP_414542.1` / `ECDH10B_0001` and overlapped their own tables by
zero ORFs.

## Four defects had to be fixed before any run could finish

Each was found by a run that reported `completed`. Nextflow ignores a process that
exhausted its retries, so a workflow with a dead step is green — the driver's `verify()`
is the only thing that says otherwise, and it was itself wrong (below).

- **`proteinbert` chunk order.** The guard against stacking chunk 10 before chunk 2
  matched a *trailing* integer; the image writes `<stem>.<k>.embedding.npy` and announces
  that pattern itself. No four-lane run had passed this step since the guard landed.
- **`python_for_data_science` at tag 1.4.0 has no pyarrow.** `gpr_4lane` imported it at
  module level and died there, after all four lanes had already succeeded. Pinned back to
  1.2.5 to finish the campaign; the durable fix came after, below.
- **Unstamped images on a read-only store.** The engine gates on `<sif>` AND
  `<sif>.verified`; an unstamped image sends the task to re-stamp it, which flocks the
  store. Sockeye's is `/arc`, read-only from a compute node, so it fell through to
  `apptainer pull` and `no route to host`. Preflight checked existence only, and now
  checks both.
- **`landed_products` read only `_manifests/`,** which these result trees do not have, so
  it called all seven targets absent from a run that had produced six.

## Then the pin moved forward instead (2026-08-24)

Reverting to 1.2.5 kept the campaign moving but left the env one bump behind a tree that
had already moved. The image is not the thing that cannot read parquet — polars carries
its own reader and writer, and only pandas' `read_parquet`/`to_parquet` are pyarrow front
ends. So the pin is 1.4.0 and the code no longer names pyarrow: `lib::fabfos_evidence`
owns `read_parquet` / `write_parquet`, chooses polars or pyarrow by what the interpreter
has, and both GPR mappers and `ptools_annotation_gather` go through it. Filter pushdown
survives the move — the bridge's uniprot slice is still cut in the reader, not on the
heap. 1.4.0 holds polars 1.43.2 and neither pyarrow nor fastparquet, measured in the
image. One thing the move cost: pandas spells a missing string NaN and polars refuses a
float among strings, so the writer translates the sentinel per column.

Checked in the image against real inputs, no Nextflow involved:

| what ran | result |
|---|---|
| `gpr_4lane` on DH1's lanes, real bridge and landmarks | 30,722 rows, **identical to the pinned table** on all 10 mapper columns |
| `build_mnxr_lookup`, old pyarrow code vs new polars code | identical rows, order and dtypes; `min()` still keeps `reviewed` |
| `ptools_annotation_gather`, same comparison | 7,873 rows identical, nulls included |
| `load_mnxr_lookup` on the 30.5M-row bridge | same md5 per slice under both engines; uniprot slice 23,525,373 rows |
| `gpr_7lane`'s four moved calls | read 4,373×512 embeddings, sliced the bridge, wrote a nullable table |
| `read_gpr`, `read_dl_ec`, `load_uniprot_to_mnxr` | as before; `read_dl_ec` keeps both predicates |

What is still unrun is the engine around it: image staging, `.verified` sidecars and the
nine-step workflow on a cluster.

## Running it again

`clone_gpr_on_hpc.py --site {fir,sockeye} --run` per ORF set, then
`rebuild_gpr_cascade.py` for everything downstream. Two things about scale, both measured
here rather than guessed:

- **A full nine-step run is ~15 minutes**, not the four hours the declared KOfam walltime
  implies. Those are ceilings.
- **fir's login node caps around six concurrent Nextflow drivers.** The seventh died with
  `unable to create native thread` before submitting anything — zero tasks recorded, and
  the other six unaffected.

`race_sites.py` runs both clusters per set and cancels the loser on the first exit 0.
`sbatch --test-only` predicted a two-day GPU wait on *both* clusters; the real wait was
twenty minutes, which is why racing beats picking.

## What still carries the old lanes

- `scadc_metagenome/gpr_4lane` — 1.4M ORFs, real queue work.
- `scadc_fosmids/gpr_4lane` and `gpr_7lane`.
- the 3 nostoc annotation tables and the 8 nostoc ecspr networks, derived from those.

These four keep their existing annotations and stay on the old mapper contract.
`validate_gpr` names them itself — they carry the retired `clean_maxsep_inv` score_kind
and warn on every read, so a mixed comparison announces itself.
