# Open followups

## What goes in this file

The punch list: bugs that are known and unfixed, risks that were accepted knowingly, and
designs that were rejected on purpose. One entry per item, naming what is wrong and the first
move. Nothing that is finished belongs here — git holds that — and nothing that a test or a
module already states belongs here either.

## Open bugs

**The e2e docker cleanup chmods every pytest tmpdir on the host, and now times out doing it.**
`tests/metasmith/e2e/docker/test_cache_real_nextflow.py::_bind_root` walks UP from the work
directory until its parent is `/tmp`, which lands on `/tmp/pytest-of-tony` — the shared root of
every pytest run this host has ever done — and then `docker run … chmod -R a+rw` that whole tree
against a fixed 120s timeout. Measured: 57,030 files and 468 MB, none of it the test's own, and
a bare `docker run … chmod` on an EMPTY directory takes 16.7s on this box. Two tests fail on the
timeout. It is a feedback loop rather than bad luck: nextflow work directories are created
root-owned inside containers, so pytest's own `rm_rf` cannot remove them
(`PermissionError: Operation not permitted`) and leaves `garbage-*` trees behind — which is what
the chmod exists to fix, and what makes it slower every run. The first move is to bind and chmod
the test's own directory rather than the walked-up root.

**`test_stage_real_libraries_clones_into_sandbox` asserts a `.git` its helper stopped writing.**
`stage_real_libraries` moved to `shutil.copytree` plus a `STAGED_FROM` file naming the source and
HEAD when the library stopped being a separate repository, and `src/metasmith_libraries` is a
plain directory in the monorepo now. The assertion should read `STAGED_FROM`.

**A transform whose product extends the type it requires is a self-loop the solver walks.**
`kbase/filter_assembly/seqkit_filter_contigs` requires `sequences::assembly` and produces
`sequences::filtered_assembly`, which `extends assembly`; `kbase/polish_assembly/polypolish`
does the same with `polished_assembly`. So each satisfies its own requirement, and a plan
targeting a filtered assembly can chain them arbitrarily deep. Measured: the parity analysis
`a4_mags_from_metagenome` solves through an ELEVEN-long filter/polish/filter ladder before
`assembly_stats`, 19 steps where 13 do the job, and every product in the ladder is consumed by
the next step so it is a real chain and not dead branches. It was five long before curation
round 6; widening `alignment::bam` perturbed the search and lengthened it, which is how it was
found. The language has no negation, so "an assembly that has not already been filtered" cannot
be said as a requirement -- the first move is to decide whether these transforms should require
a narrower type than the one they extend, or whether the refiner should reject a candidate that
re-derives an ancestor of its own input.

**A directory-typed given whose content changes below its top level keeps its leaf id, so the
cache serves stale results as if they were this run's.** A leaf id is absolute path plus
`mtime_ns` — no content, no size, no inode — and it stats the top-level directory only, so an
in-place edit or any create/delete/replace inside a subdirectory leaves the id where it was and
every cacheable step hits. Reproduced end-to-end against a real `dvc checkout`, with a
restat-only control that does not hit, so the hit is caused by the identity and nothing else.
Reachable here: `ref::ezpred_model` is directory-typed over a dvc `.dir` with 45 files below
depth 1, and 6 of 11 dvc-tracked reference dirs share that shape. `ref::kofamscan_profiles`
escapes only because its files sit flat at depth 1, which one reorganisation would undo. The
first move is content addressing with stat demoted to a memo key — that changes
`CACHE_KEY_VERSION` and invalidates every existing shard, so it is a migration, not a patch.
Ships unfixed in 0.22.0. That release moves `CACHE_KEY_VERSION` to 5 for an unrelated reason —
the unit became one group member's invocation — so the epoch bump users pay for buys nothing
here, and the migration this entry wants still costs a second one.

**Cancelling a run during its first minute silently does nothing.** `CancelWorkflow` keys on
`PID.lock`, which `start.sh` writes only once nextflow is up, while `RUN.token` lands as soon as
the launcher detaches. Measured on the docker lane: 22:40 for the token, 22:41 for the lock. A
cancel in that window returns `method: noop`, `status: not_running` — and the run then proceeds.
`ps` already reports the run during the same window, so the two disagree about whether anything
is running. The user-visible shape is a cancel button that reports nothing to stop and leaves the
run going. Either widen what cancel will act on to the run pgid `start.sh` already records, or
have it wait out the startup window rather than answer from a file that is not there yet.

**`check_launch` reads the config before `resource_overrides` is applied.** In
`agents/workflow_ops.py`, the preflight at the top of the launch runs against the transforms'
declared numbers, and the caller's per-step overrides land afterwards. So a caller who has
already capped every step to fit the host is still refused, and `METASMITH_SKIP_RESOURCE_CHECK=1`
is the only way through. The overrides do win once the run starts, confirmed from the generated
`workflow.config.nf` — this is ordering, not precedence.

**The local executor silently ignores `-params-file` for its memory cap.** The `params{
executor{ memory } }` block in `local.nf` wins over the params file, because the executor
scope resolves params at config-build time, before the file merges. Anything declaring more
than the preset's cap is refused before it runs. Override the cap through a literal `-config`
block rather than through `params.*`, or auto-size the executor to the host. Related footgun:
`errorStrategy='ignore'` makes a run that hit this report success with zero outputs — check
the output count, not the run status.

**The logistics e2e tests cannot pass under the `local` preset** for that reason: six
`download*` transforms declare far more memory than the preset allows, and the visible symptom
is `No reads downloaded from SRA`. Host RAM is irrelevant. The class also carries `slow` and
`network` marks that nothing deselects, and `network` is registered project-wide with a
different meaning, so an opt-in-looking test is always on. Decide between the test naming an
override, the preset defaulting to the host's real memory, and the suite honouring its marks —
three policies, not three spellings of one fix.

**`Agent.Deploy` raises a bare `AssertionError` instead of naming the failure.** It asserts
one output line per command, which undercounts whenever remote home-resolution drops a line —
an allocation-coded `/scratch` that refuses `mkdir`, for instance. It should report which path
it failed to resolve.

**A source checkout computes a container tag that 404s.** With no build hash, the tag degrades
to the bare version, while the published image carries the hash suffix. Pass `container=`
explicitly when driving from a source tree; conda installs bake the hash in.

**`Orchestrator.group()` barriers non-parent streams until the upstream channel closes**,
so a terminal aggregation deadlocks when upstream uses `errorStrategy='ignore'` or retries
that never reach a terminal state.

**The generated `stub:` block sorts a shared index value list in place.** Groovy's
`List.sort()` mutates, and index value lists are shared by reference across the DAG — this is
the one known writer, and it sits in generated code where the audit of `Orchestrator.groovy`
does not reach. `v.sort(false)` returns a copy and is the whole fix.

**The results index of a chunked step records only leaf ancestors and drops the chunk.**
Nothing reads that index today, so the loss is invisible; anything that later asks which chunk
produced a file gets a plausible answer built from the wrong level. Decide first whether the
index is a provenance record or a convenience lookup — the two want different walks.

**A one-ULP `log2` difference between the two solvers can still flip an `argmax` at a
near-tie.** The policy this entry used to ask for is now set: `SOLVER_VALUE_TOLERANCE_ULP` in
`models/solver_rng.py` states that the draw stream is exact and derived values carry libm's last
digit, and the differential test enforces exactly that. Measured against a staged binary that
post-dates the last change to `src/workflow_solver/`, so the stale-binary caveat this entry used
to carry does not apply: 8 of 36,290 values differ across the five seeds, all `log2`, all 1 ULP,
zero draw-count mismatches. What stays open is the consequence, not the divergence — nothing
establishes how near a tie has to be for that last digit to change a plan, and the corpus has
never been searched for one.

**Two solver tests are expensive and sit in an axis that says they are not.** One solves every
shipped template and one walks the corpus; together they dominate a gate meant to be quick.
The axis is assigned by directory and markers are additive, so adding `slow` does not remove
`fast` — moving them means changing `_DIR_MARKERS` or the file's location.

**Nine tier-4 readers still resolve a data path the monorepo migration retired.** The
replacement is not the same data, so anything quoted from an old run has to be re-run rather
than re-labelled.

**The two-point probe is not declared as a transform, so the community lane cannot be
re-measured.** Blocked on a type question rather than forgotten: both probes write one result
type, and two producers of a single type give the planner nothing to tell them apart, so the
declaration has to introduce the distinction first.

**The four-plan binning comparison harness may be routing around a constraint that no longer
exists.** `TargetBuilder` refuses the same target type with the same *parents*, not the same
type — and the same file exercises the same-type-different-parents shape the harness says is
impossible. Whether it collapses to one plan is a library-design call.

## Accepted risks

**An external mtime-touching event makes the next run cold, and one file is enough.** Stat
addressing bought the thing it was for — a 24 GB DIAMOND database or a 27k-file profiles tree
costs one stat instead of a full-tree hash — and the price is that only leaves inside a given
data library are stat-keyed, so moving one of them empties the whole hit set, including
downstream steps that never read it. `rsync -a` preserves mtimes, so staging does not itself
re-key; exposure is external events, and `dvc checkout` under a reference tree is the live one.
Mitigation is to pin the library: `restat_leaf_ids()` skips pinned libraries by design. The
same identity scheme fails the other way under *Open bugs*, and one fix answers both.

**A mutable container tag can produce a false cache hit.** A container's leaf id addresses the
docker URL string, not the resolved image digest, so a pinned tag busts the cache on a version
bump and `:latest` does not. Inherent to tag-addressing; mitigated by the convention of
pinning biocontainer tags.

**A crash between a task's promote and the driver's `record_run` leaves a shard with no sqlite
row.** The rename is atomic and the probe reads the manifest, so the shard still serves. Only
`msm cache ls` and `gc` miss it, until a later run that hits it upserts the row. An orphaned
`<key>.<host>.<pid>.tmp` from a killed task is never reclaimed: nothing sweeps them, correctly,
since a dead writer on another host cannot be distinguished from a live one.

**A hit costs one helper subprocess per batch and one local task per hit batch.** The helper
(`python -m metasmith.caching.invocation`) takes about 0.07 s per call in the agent environment,
flat from 1 to 200 members, so a 200-batch step pays about 14 s of interpreter start-up on the
head node. Measured on this host only, not on a cluster submit node.

**A DVC-pinned artifact whose objects leave every cache is unrecoverable.** The live instance is
`data/fabfos/runs/aska/gpr`: no remote is configured, the pinned generation exists nowhere but a
shared local cache that no longer holds it, and the files on disk are hardlinks into that cache —
so `dvc checkout --force` would delete them with nothing to restore. The rule that manages this
is under *When a build artifact may be DVC-pinned* in `docs/metasmith/architecture.md`.

**A database transform fetches and indexes under one cache key, so an indexing failure discards
the archive.** `FetchCommand` makes a *retry in the same work directory* free — the transfer lands
on `<dest>.part` and is promoted only when it is whole — but nextflow gives a retry a fresh work
directory by default, so that only helps a re-run that reuses the directory. The durable fix is to
split each downloader into a fetch transform and an index transform, so the fetch is a cache entry
of its own. That is a library-shape change: `downloadUniRef50DB`, `downloadKofamDB` and
`downloadInterProScanDB` each grow an intermediate `ref::` type, and every plan that names them
re-solves.

## Deliberately rejected

**Deep-copying index value lists.** The lists are shared by reference across the DAG and the
no-writer rule is enforced only at the top-level map, but every production write was audited
and none mutates a value list. Copying changes the rendered index, which feeds
`file_instance_id`, which would orphan every existing cache shard. Reach for it the first time
a value-list mutation actually appears.

**A close-time "this stream contributed nothing" assertion.** A stream that delivers no items
is the legitimate optional-branch case, so asserting there fails runs that are behaving
correctly. The per-item guard catches the reported case earlier anyway.

## Validation gaps

**No transform body has been run under the MAMBA runtime since the execution arms were
collapsed.** Every check in curation round 6 was under DOCKER. The collapse means one command
now serves both routes, and `_ExecInEnv` was already the sole executor for both arms, so the
change is small -- but "small" is what the arms claimed too, and an arm that has never been run
answers wrongly. `dev/libraries.sh --create-envs` builds the conda environments to run one
against.

**The caching and reentrancy path has never been run live through the sockeye relay.** The
cross-host proof was assembled from separate hosts showing cache-key identity, not from one
relayed run.

**Deploy-and-run end to end on the HPC hosts was red at the last check** and has not been
re-verified since the bind failure was made fail-fast.

**No test stages one data library under two task keys**, in either the virtual runtime or the
`-stub` docker lane. 0.22.1 stopped a staged leaf's id depending on the task key, so this is a
regression guard rather than a way to see an open bug -- and the defect it would guard needed a
93-minute real run to find, twice. The same blind spot hid a record-path bug: the docker lane
promotes from the host, so a container-side path never enters a cache record.

**Closed at 0.22.0: the published artifacts are now driven as a user receives them.** The
release guards still only inspect the artifact as the builder sees it — `-ud` reads the locally
built image, `-uc` installs from `file://conda_build` — so the consumer check is a separate pass
and stays manual: `mamba create -c hallamlab -c bioconda -c conda-forge metasmith=<version>` from
outside every worktree with `env -u PYTHONPATH`, then `msm --help`, a rust solver report, a
`clone_stdlib` into an empty project and every shipped template solved; and the same drive inside
the image after `docker rmi` and a fresh `docker pull`, so the registry copy is what runs. Both
lanes were green for 0.22.0 (11/11 templates, `backend=rust`, library stamp `0.22.0+53d5540`
identical in both artifacts). Nothing automates this, so it is a gap again the moment a release
ships without somebody running it.

That pass proves the artifacts **plan**; it runs no workflow. The separate question of whether a
release *executes* correctly is answered by driving the annotation trio at two then three
samples: `/home/tony/msm.gate022/GATE.md` for 0.22.0, which failed it, and
`/home/tony/msm.gate0221/GATE.md` for 0.22.1, which passes. Worth repeating per release, since
planning green and running green are different claims and only the second one has found
anything.
