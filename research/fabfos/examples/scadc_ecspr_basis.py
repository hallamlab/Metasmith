"""The basis the SCADC fosmid measurement runs on: the deployed bake, decoded and named.

    python research/fabfos/examples/scadc_ecspr_basis.py            # names + axes
    python research/fabfos/examples/scadc_ecspr_basis.py --out DIR  # elsewhere

Writes `metabolite_names.parquet`, `terminals.json` and `axes.json` under
`data/scratch/scadc_ecspr/basis/`. The two decoded bake tables are NOT written here --
they are the shared cache `bake_pairs` maintains, and this prints where they landed.

THE ARM MEASURES MANY AXES, NOT ONE, and `ecspr_axes` says how many: set4's 79, plus the
three glycerol-backbone axes added beside it, plus one per (declared axis, host-present
member) where set4 names a metabolite the EPI300 graph does not carry. Each is one source
and one sink on one element. The published four-hub merged axis is appended last, carried
forward unchanged so a rebuilt path can be checked against a number that already exists.

TWO DIFFERENT CHECKS, BECAUSE THE TWO SETS ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THING. The four hubs
are carried as NAMES and resolved against the bake, because an id is a fact about one
MetaNetX release and this arm has already outlived one. set4 IS ids -- that is what the
frozen file contains, and no name in it is authoritative -- so its endpoints get the
other half of the same guard: every one must be a node in its own element's pair table,
and any that is not is named. A conditions table naming metabolites the graph has never
heard of measures a run of structural zeros that looks exactly like a biological finding.

TIER4 IS RETIRED, AND THIS FILE IS WHERE THAT LANDED. The generation this replaces read
`data/fabfos/benchmark/reference_tier4/atom_pairs_tier4.parquet` and joined the bake's
direction table through `vocab` by hand. That pin was dropped when `metabolism_bake`
became the atom-pair basis; the path does not exist, so the old script could not run at
all -- and the measurement it produced is on a basis nothing else in this tree shares.
Decoding goes through `bake_pairs`/`bake_identity` instead, which stamps every cache with
the bake it came from and refuses to serve one decoded from another.

`metabolite_names` IS A FUNCTION OF THE BAKE and has to be rebuilt with it: it is
chem_prop restricted to the metabolites the bake actually pairs, so a metabolite a new
bake reaches is simply absent from an older copy. It exists so a terminal can be resolved
by NAME and checked present, which is the check the retired generation did not have on
its own conditions table.
