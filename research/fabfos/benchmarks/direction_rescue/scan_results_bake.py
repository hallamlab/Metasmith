"""Which bake each ECSPr RESULT chunk was computed on, and how strong that evidence is.

    PYTHONPATH=src mamba run -n ecspr python \
        research/fabfos/benchmarks/direction_rescue/scan_results_bake.py

`scan_direction_caches.py` beside this one covers DECODE CACHES -- files named
`direction_ratios`, which carry a `.from` stamp and can be checked exactly. Nothing
covered the results, and results are where the staleness is read as a finding: a chunk
holds numbers somebody quotes, carries no stamp, and says nothing about the basis it was
measured on. This is the missing half.

THREE GRADES OF EVIDENCE, and the report says which one each row rests on.

  measured   the chunk carries a basis table of its own -- a composed `direction.parquet`
             under `networks/` -- so its ratios are compared to the deployed bake's
             directly. This is the only grade that proves anything.
  stamped    a `.from` sidecar written through `bake_identity`.
  dated      neither: the chunk's pin commit and its file mtimes are bracketed against
             the promote dates below. A DATE IS NOT A PROOF. It says which bake was
             deployed when the bytes were written, not which one the writer read -- a
             script pointed at a staged chunk, or one serving a stale decode cache, dates
             the same as one that read the deployed bake.

A chunk can be BOTH r10 and not, and that is the case worth catching: nostoc's composed
networks were recut on r10 while the measurements taken on them were not re-run, so the
basis and the numbers beside it come from two different bakes inside one pin.
