"""Run the ASKA/FFA panel through the packaged ECSPr command line.

Four `ecspr` invocations and no solver code: `draw` mints the null pool as a
conditions table, the two probes run over the observed conditions and over that
pool with the SAME command, and `score` turns the pair into deltas and z-scores.
The null arm being the identical probe call with a different `--conditions` file
is the whole reason a z means anything here.

THE GATE IS RUN FIRST AND ON PURPOSE. `--draws 32` costs a couple of minutes and
answers the expensive question before the thousand is drawn: is the null's spread
large compared with the CONTROLS' spread? The controls are masks that reach no
atom-mapped reaction, so they must return the baseline exactly and their spread is
the solver's numerical floor. If the null does not clear that floor, every z below
it is noise over noise, and no number of draws fixes it.

    ./dev.sh -e --where                     # confirm which ecspr is imported
    python main/benchmarks/aska/run_panel.py --draws 32     # the gate
    python main/benchmarks/aska/run_panel.py --draws 1000   # the run

Solves shard per condition and resume from what is on disk, because this
workstation kills long local jobs and a thousand-draw null is exactly the shape of
run that gets killed at draw 900.

THE TWO ARMS SHARE A POOL BY SHARING A FILE, and the pool is seeded once. Re-drawing
with a different seed voids the comparison, so the seed is an argument with a
default rather than something regenerated per run.
