"""The eydallin clones' edges, read off the curated model. The DIRECT route.

    mamba run -n msm-fabfos python research/fabfos/benchmarks/eydallin/build_clone_gpr.py
    ... --publish        # writes data/fabfos/runs/eydallin_clones/gpr/

Two lines of evidence answer "what reactions does this clone add", and this is the one
that asks a curated genome-scale model. The other reads the sequence -- the four
annotation lanes over `eydallin_clones.faa` -- and the comparison between them is the
point, which is why they are separate files on one schema rather than one merged table.

IT READS THE HOST'S OWN TABLE, NOT THE MODEL. `data/fabfos/benchmarks/hosts/e_coli_ag1/
gpr_gem.parquet` already carries every (model gene -> reaction -> MNXR) row for AG1,
crosswalked once and labelled with `in_atom_universe` against one bake. Re-deriving that
here from the JSON would put a second resolver in the tree, and two resolvers over one
model is how a clone's edge and the background's edge for the same reaction come to
disagree. Subsetting is also what makes the AG1 edit list bind: `GTPDPK` is absent from
the background because relA1 broke it, so a relA clone cannot silently add it back
through a path the host table never had.

A CLONE'S NAME IS RESOLVED THROUGH THE B-NUMBER, exactly as the ORF set is. The model
names its genes by current symbol and the paper writes 2010 symbols, so `erfK` has to
become `ldtA` before it will match, and `pfs` `mtnN`. The chain is
name -> b-number (MG1655 GenBank, synonyms included) -> MG1655's current symbol ->
the model's gene of that name.

COVERAGE IS THE RESULT, NOT A PROBLEM. A curated model is a claim about central
metabolism, and this cohort is a genome-wide screen: most of its 86 genes are
regulators, transporters and y-genes the model never claimed. The count that comes out
of here is what the de-novo half is measured against, so it is printed and written and
never filled in.
