# The set4 biomass axes, and the lipid backbone axes added beside them.
#
# set4 is 79 hand-curated source->sink axes over four elements. It is graph-independent --
# the same table whichever universe the solve runs on -- so it carries a frozen sha rather
# than a producer, and `REFERENCES.md` C1 declares it git text for that reason. It lived
# outside this repository until now, behind an absolute path into a project directory that
# was later emptied; `SET4` below is the recovered copy and `SET4_SHA` is the pin every
# consumer already asserted against the old location.
#
# THE EXTENSION IS A SECOND FILE, and that is the whole design. set4's sha is asserted by
# consumers this module does not own, so an axis added by editing set4 would break them
# for a reason that has nothing to do with them. Adding a file leaves set4 byte-identical
# and makes "which axes are set4" answerable by pointing at one sha.
#
# WHAT THE LIPID EXTENSION IS FOR. set4's `phospholipid` category is five axes and every
# one arrives at PE or PG from the acyl-chain side (AcCoA), the head-group side (L-serine)
# or the phosphate side. None of them carries the glycerol backbone, whose carbon enters at
# DHAP and reaches the head group through gpsA, plsB/plsC and CDP-DAG -- so an insert that
# builds backbone and no acyl chain is invisible to set4 as frozen. The three added axes
# are that entry: glucose to DHAP, and DHAP to each of PE and PG.
