"""Every SCALEs gene, TWO conductance readouts each on LW06, scored as their ratio.

    mamba run -n ecspr python research/fabfos/benchmarks/woodruff/sweeps/sweep_woodruff_ratio.py \
        --channel gem --fold-check         # the two preconditions, solves nothing else
    ... --channel gem --workers 3
    ... --channel denovo --workers 3                    # unfiltered, ~40 min
    ... --channel denovo --min-lanes 2 --workers 3      # the lane filter, clone-side

    ratio = C(pyruvate -> ethanol) / C(pyruvate -> oxaloacetate)

WHY A RATIO AND NOT A DELTA. A two-point effective conductance is monotone in every edge
conductance (Rayleigh), so a x2 fold on any gene's reactions can only push a single
readout UP. A signed phenotype -- this gene helps production, that one hurts it -- is
inexpressible in one such readout. Dividing two competing fates of the SAME source
metabolite is what makes the score two-sided: pyruvate is the branch point the engineered
ethanologen was built around, ethanol is where LW06 is supposed to send it, and
oxaloacetate is the anaplerotic fate that competes for it. A gene that raises both legs
equally scores zero; only a gene that shifts the SPLIT registers.

THE TWO CONDUCTANCES ARE INDEPENDENT SOLVES on the same graph, not two readings of one.
Each builds its own terminal pair; only the graph and its weights are shared. Doubling
the probes doubles the per-gene cost, and that is the price of the normalisation.

THE DENOMINATOR IS NOT ONE COMMITTED ENZYME, AND THAT IS A REAL LIMIT OF THIS ARM.
iML1515 carries NO pyruvate carboxylase: `pyc` has zero GPR rows in this host. Every
pyruvate -> oxaloacetate route here is therefore indirect -- through PEP (`ppsA`, or
`pykA`/`pykF` run backwards, then `ppc`, the model's single PEP-carboxylase row) or
through malate (`maeA`/`maeB`, then `mdh` or `mqo`). The ratio still solves and both legs
are finite, but the denominator measures a diffuse anaplerotic capacity spread over eight
or so reactions rather than the sensitivity of one committed step. The eydallin
benchmark's glycogen -> pyruvate arm did have a committed enzyme behind it; this one does
not, and a null here is correspondingly less sharp.

THE BACKGROUND IS THE `in_atom_universe` FILTER, WHICH IS THIS BENCHMARK'S CONVENTION AND
NOT THE EYDALLIN SWEEP'S. `sweeps/sweep_scales.py` settled it and `panels/sink_panel.py`
follows it: transport reactions carry atom pairs and therefore real edges, and leaving
them in lets carbon reach a sink through a periplasmic shortcut that performs no
chemistry. 1,409 reactions filtered against 2,186 unfiltered on this host. NOTHING HERE
IS COMPARABLE TO AN EYDALLIN NUMBER, which used an unfiltered weight dict.

THE TWO CHANNELS' CONDUCTANCES ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO EACH OTHER EITHER -- backgrounds of
1,409 curated and 8,560 de-novo reactions on the same host. Only ranks within one channel
are, and the two reach the shared filter convention by different routes: the GEM table
carries `in_atom_universe`, while the de-novo table arrives entirely null and has the flag
recomputed here against the bake's own atom universe (`host_weights` refuses if either
stops being true).

THE DE-NOVO CHANNEL IS PROMISCUOUS AND `--min-lanes` IS THE KNOWN ANSWER, NOT A TUNING
KNOB. In the eydallin benchmark one ProtBERT call assigned glgC's committed step to 27
unrelated ORFs -- secE, cyoA-D, nuoA, rpsJ, tolR among them -- which tied at an identical
delta, filled the top of the ranking and pushed the AUC BELOW chance rather than to it;
`--min-lanes 2` moved it 0.4636 -> 0.4922. The same promiscuity is visible here before any
statistic: unfiltered, this cohort's de-novo table gives `adhP` 142 reactions against the
curated channel's 2, and 7.75 reactions per clone on average. The filter is applied
CLONE-SIDE ONLY. Applying it to the background is what disconnected eydallin's target
outright, because the committed step had single-lane support, and there would have been no
probe left to run.

FOLD MULTIPLIES; IT DOES NOT UNION. Every gene in this library is a gene the host already
carries, so an implementation that added a clone's reactions to the background as a SET
would be the identity map and the whole sweep would return flat -- which reads as a null
result rather than as a bug. `--fold-check` exists so that failure cannot happen quietly:
it solves a named host gene at fold 1.0 and 2.0, prints the set-union control beside
them, and REFUSES to proceed unless multiplication moves the ratio and union does not.

THREE HOST-DELETED REACTIONS ARE REFUSED RATHER THAN RESTORED. LW06 is BW25113 with
ldhA, ackA, frdABCD and adhE knocked out, and the clone GPR table was built against
unedited iML1515, so `ldhA`, `frdA`, `frdB` and `frdD` nominate LDH_D, FRD2 and FRD3 --
reactions this host does not have. Folding a weight the background does not carry is not
dosage, it is topology, and the fold semantics cannot express it; restoring FRD2/FRD3
would be worse still, since its GPR rule is `frdA and frdB and frdC and frdD` and every
one of the four is deleted, so no single-gene clone reconstitutes the complex. Those
reactions are dropped from those genes' fold sets and the affected genes fall through to
the exact-zero population with the reason printed. Four genes of 4,225, stated rather
than silently folded.

A GENE WITH NO ATOM-MAPPED REACTION IS AN EXACT ZERO, not an absence. It is never solved
-- folding nothing is the identity -- but it gets its row, because it is a gene the
screen measured and this method cannot see. Dropping those rows would silently redefine
the population as "genes the model happens to carry".

UNDER A DELETION THE DENOMINATOR CAN REACH ZERO, which doubling never allows. `--fold 0`
can disconnect oxaloacetate from pyruvate outright while ethanol is still reachable. That
is not a solver failure and not an infinity to be clipped; it is recorded as
`sink_severed`. Where BOTH legs go to zero the gene has severed pyruvate from the network
on both sides and the ratio is genuinely undefined -- `isolated`, counted separately,
never folded in with the first.
