"""The three ratio arms on one cut: how much of each screen is metabolically active,
what carries the response, and whether the sign is right.

    mamba run -n msm python research/fabfos/benchmarks/ratio_cross_arm.py

Each arm already ships a classifier report and each prints the same reach 2x2, the same
mid-rank Mann-Whitney AUC and the same reaction-count size control. None of them prints
the REACTION-level cut, which is the question this file answers: of the positives a
conductance probe can see at all, how many actually move, how few reactions carry that
movement, and does the movement point the way the phenotype says it should.

THE CUT IS ONE DEFINITION APPLIED THREE TIMES, and the whole point is that it is the same
one, so read the columns across arms rather than down:

    metabolically active   a positive carrying at least one atom-mapped reaction (n_rxn > 0).
                           This is the only population a carbon-flow probe has a mechanism
                           for; the rest are regulators, transporters and hypotheticals a
                           stoichiometric model has no representation for.
    responder              |delta_ratio_pct| > 1e-12. Separates "the probe sees it and it
                           does not move" from "the probe cannot see it", which the AUC
                           conflates and which decide different things.
    mover                  |delta_ratio_pct| >= 1%. Every arm shows an order-of-magnitude
                           gap at roughly this point; below it the values are solver dust
                           (eydallin's 23 responders run down to 6e-7%).
    carrying reactions     the union of the movers' `rxns`. A gene is not a lever, its
                           reactions are, and two genes nominating one shared reaction is
                           one measurement rather than two.

THE SIGN NEEDS A DECLARED EXPECTATION AND ONLY TWO ARMS HAVE ONE. eydallin's labels are
signed (glycogen_excess vs glycogen_deficient) and fang's are (up vs down vs flat, flat
excluded because it expects nothing). woodruff's are not: every positive is "tolerant",
so there is no direction to be right or wrong about and this file reports the raw up/down
split instead of manufacturing an agreement statistic. Do not add one -- a one-sided label
set makes any such number a restatement of the probe's own bias.

REPORT SIGN AGREEMENT AGAINST THE MAJORITY-CLASS BASE RATE, NEVER BARE. Every one of these
label sets is lopsided (eydallin's positives are 74% deficient, fang's signed ones 70%
down), so a coin that always guesses the majority scores 70-76% and beats most of the real
numbers here. The bare percentage reads as a result and is not one.
