"""One cohort -> the three tables `ecspr fba` reads. Shared by every flux balance arm.

WHY THIS IS SHARED AND NOT COPIED. Fuhrer, the Eydallin 2007 mutants and Keio are the same
experiment three times: a host GPR table, a table of ORFs each mutant deletes, and a set of
metabolites to measure the flux to. A second copy of that reader is a second answer, which
is the same reason `ecspr.model.fba` exists rather than a loader per arm.

A COHORT THAT ALREADY HAS A CONDITIONS TABLE PASSES IT IN, and that is the case worth
having: the SCADC fosmids were built through `ecspr conditions` for the conductance arm, so
the flux balance arm reads that very table and the two arms are measuring one construction
rather than two that were written to agree. `conditions_path` is how a cohort says so, and
`conditions()` below is only for a cohort that has none.

WHAT A COHORT STILL HAS TO SAY FOR ITSELF is its frame, its host table, its deletion table,
its medium and its sinks. Those are the `Cohort` fields, and they are the only thing an arm's
own `build_tables.py` should hold.

THE SUBTRACT GOES ON `orf`. Keying it on `mnxr` renormalises the surviving nominators -- by
as much as 41% on a fan-out of three -- and deletes an isozyme's contribution along with the
deleted gene's. `orf` is a nominator: subtracting one leaves another gene's row for a
reaction two genes nominate, which is what a single-gene knockout actually does.

A MUTANT WHOSE GENE CARRIES NO REACTION OF THE FRAME STILL GETS A CONDITION, and it comes
out identical to the baseline. That is the honest answer -- the model cannot represent that
deletion -- and it keeps the population the one the screen measured rather than the subset
the model happens to cover. Those mutants are marked `is_control`: a real perturbation that
cannot move the measurement is what a noise floor is made of.

DO NOT GAPFILL A DELETION COHORT'S BASELINE WITHOUT READING ITS CARVE FIRST. A gapfill draws
on exactly what the carve removed, so if the carve is reproducing the host strain's own
genotype -- BW25113 is daraBAD, dlacZ, drhaBAD against the MG1655 model iML1515 -- the repair
puts those deletions back. `probe_axes` prints the carved set for that reason.
