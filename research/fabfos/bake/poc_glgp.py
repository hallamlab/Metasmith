"""The reaction the concern was raised about, and the bake's own arithmetic re-derived.

MNXR145036 is glycogen phosphorylase. MetaNetX writes it `G1P = Glycogen + Pi`, the
substitution lane restages it as `alpha-maltotriose + G1P = alpha-maltotetraose + Pi`, and
r9 shipped ratio 0.204 -- polymer synthesis favoured about 5:1, which is backwards from what
glgP and malP do.

Nothing about that number was wrong as thermodynamics. dG'o = -4.18 kJ/mol is the standard
state, every participant at 1 M, and a phosphorylase's equilibrium constant genuinely sits
near unity. What decides its direction in a cell is that [Pi] runs two orders above [G1P],
because phosphoglucomutase drains G1P as fast as it appears. That is a Q term, and r9 had
no Q term.

r10 DOES, so this script's job changed. It recomputes the correction from the pinned
concentration table and the restaged equation, INDEPENDENTLY of the lane, and checks it
against the `dG_correction` the deployed annotation carries. Agreement is the check; the
walk-through below is what makes the number readable.

The two glucans cancel: they are the same polymer at n and n+1, so their activity RATIO is
1 whatever the polymer's concentration is. That is the whole reason the restaged form is the
one a concentration term can be applied to at all -- MetaNetX's one-sided form leaves a
glucosyl unit unaccounted for, and a correction applied to it prices a molecule that is not
there.
