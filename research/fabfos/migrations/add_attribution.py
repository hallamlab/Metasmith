`genome_unit` names ONE PHYSICALLY SEPARATE COPY OF DNA INSIDE ONE CELL. It is the grain
evidence pools over, and `nomination_contributions` namespaces the ORF by it -- so a table
without one pools every ORF it holds as though they sat on one copy. Three tables in this
tree were written before the block existed, and each needs a different answer.

  nostoc NOS / ERY / RHI   ONE ORGANISM PER TABLE, so the unit is the organism and
                           `source` already carries it. Adding the column is NUMERICALLY
                           INERT: a constant column adds nothing to a groupby's partition,
                           and a constant ORF prefix changes no dedup. `--report` measures
                           that rather than asserting it.

  scadc_fosmids            ONE FOSMID INSERT IS ONE UNIT, and the insert is the head of the
                           ORF name -- `pool01_ATTGAGCC:megahit:k141_112:1-18882_1` is ORF 1
                           of insert `...:1-18882`. This is NOT inert: the table currently
                           pools 63,914 rows as one anonymous copy, so an insert-level unit
                           is a correction and `--report` prices it.

  scadc_metagenome         ONE ANONYMOUS UNIT, and that is a claim rather than a
                           placeholder. The unit there is a MAG and this table carries no
                           binning at all -- `orf` names a contig, and contigs of one
                           genome are one cell's DNA, so a contig-level unit would claim a
                           separateness the data does not support. `genome_unit = source`
                           says "one pool of DNA I cannot separate", which is exactly the
                           pooling grain the table already had, so it is inert too.

  gpr_denovo_mapper x7     ONE GENOME PER TABLE, and `source` is its accession. The same
                           case as nostoc, and inert for the same reason.

Two files under `runs/e_coli_epi300/gpr/` are deliberately absent from this list. They are
reaction SETS -- mnxr x channel x origin, no nominator and no weight -- from an older
host-plus-insert union arm, so the evidence schema has nothing to describe there.
`gpr_to_llr.py` and `tests/fabfos/test_gpr_schema.py` name them for the same reason.

`source` IS NOT THE UNIT on a pipeline-written table -- scadc's is the engine's instance id
(`1-1-1.sLtui6SR1GPBQSMO-dYNQuWp0`), which is why it moves to `build_id` here.

**WARNING** NEVER WRITE THROUGH A FILE UNDER `data/`. See `_write`.
