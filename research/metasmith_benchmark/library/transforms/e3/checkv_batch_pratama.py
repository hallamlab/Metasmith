# CheckV over ONE slice of the frozen viral set.
#
# A pinned copy of the standard viromics/checkv.py, per batch instead of over the whole set: the standard
# transform is never edited in place, because that would retire its entries for every other experiment.
# The E3 driver masks the standard checkv.py so these two never both answer viromics::checkv_*.
#
# Chunking is safe here for the same reason it is for prodigal-gv: every table CheckV writes is one row per
# contig, scored against its own database, so a batch's rows are identical to those contigs' rows inside the
# whole set. A scheduling change, no deviation row.
