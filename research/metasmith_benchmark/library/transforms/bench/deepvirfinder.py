# DeepVirFinder over one assembly, as Pratama ran it: `dvf.py -l 1000`. The paper's Methods cut is
# score >= 0.9 and p-value <= 0.05, but this transform applies none of it: the per-contig table is
# the product and no call joins the frozen viral set here. e3::deepvirfinder_pratama is the one that
# applies the cut and feeds the pooled caller set.

    # Theano compiles its kernels on first use and needs a writable cache. CAUTION dvf.py predicts in a
    # multiprocessing pool whose workers share that cache and race for its lock, and one task died with
    # `FileExistsError: ... compiledir_.../lock_dir`. The cure is to compile BEFORE the pool exists: a
    # one-contig run warms the cache serially, so every worker then finds it built and takes no lock.
    # `compiledir_format=%(process_id)s` is NOT the cure -- Theano 1.0 has no such key and raises
    # `KeyError: 'process_id'` at import, which failed every task in 16 s.
    # CAUTION dvf.py has an upstream crash we must dodge by pre-filtering. Its encode loop flushes every
    # 100 ACCEPTED contigs and clears its buffers (`if len(seqname) % 100 == 0: ... code = []`), and the
    # tail block afterwards calls `zip(*pool.map(pred, range(0, len(code))))` UNCONDITIONALLY while the
    # append above it stays guarded. So when the accepted count is an exact multiple of 100 AND the LAST
    # record in the file is rejected, `code` is empty and dvf.py dies with
    # `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 0)` -- after a full run's work.
    # Measured: a metagem sample with exactly 69,600 accepted contigs failed identically at 32/64/128 GB
    # (55:23 / 58:12 / 58:34), while 70,116 (%100=16) and 145,469 (%100=69) passed. Handing dvf.py only
    # records it accepts makes the final record always append, so the tail always has work.
