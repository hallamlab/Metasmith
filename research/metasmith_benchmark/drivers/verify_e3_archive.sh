#                    Answers "was every file offered" for all 108,004 task_cache files in one API
#                    call, where a recursive listing of that tree does not return at all.
#   resync           the strongest. Resubmit the identical batch with --sync-level checksum. Zero
#                    bytes transferred means every source file is at the destination with matching
#                    content *now*, which is the part `delivered` cannot speak to. Slow: it reads
#                    and checksums 3.78 TB on both ends, so hours, and it crawls once it reaches the
#                    large files. Judge progress by Bytes Transferred staying 0, not by rate.
#   listing + diff   a path diff against the pre-transfer manifest, for everything except
#                    task_cache. Catches a subtree dropped by name, and names which one.
#   roundtrip-*      hashes the three files that exist nowhere else, fetched back from the archive,
#                    and reads the archived index to confirm it still reports the right counts.
#
# The diff's expected set is the manifest, minus four things and plus two things.
#
# CAUTION The manifest covers the home minus nxf_work/, results/ and relay/, but it still lists
# `.staging` -- 20 truncated partial downloads the transfer skips. Subtract them.
#
# CAUTION The transfer runs with recursive_symlinks=ignore, so Globus transfers none of the
# manifest's 3,511 symlinks. It neither follows them nor recreates them. Subtract them too, or
# the diff reports 3,511 false absences and a real one hides inside the noise. Losing them costs
# nothing: 3,510 point into the excluded nxf_work/ and would have dangled, and their content is
# archived as meta/step_logs_Qt0rbV1R.tar.gz. The 1 survivor is a logs.latest convenience link.
#
# Added after the manifest was taken, so the script adds them back: results/_metadata (10 files
# and 2 directories, moved by its own task because they are the only files under results/ that
# are not hardlinks), and metasmith/relay/msm_relay (the relay executable, which the relay/
# exclusion dropped along with the 25 worthless per-node sockets).
#
# The listing is cached per top-level subtree under WORK, so a rerun after an interrupted listing
# resumes instead of restarting.
