"""Scores the nf-core/mag control arm's bins with AMBER, outside any metasmith plan.

Acceptance criterion 12 scores BOTH arms by AMBER against the same gold standard, and
nf-core/mag does not run AMBER at all. Criterion 8 sanctions exactly this shape: a
post-hoc scorer whose output is identical in format to the in-plan scorer's. This script
is that scorer, and it is deliberately a transcription of two library transforms rather
than an independent implementation --
`transforms/metagenomics/binning/cami_contig_truth.py` for the gold standard and
`transforms/metagenomics/binning/amber.py` for the scoring call. It runs the same
`resources/lib/cami_gold_standard.py`, in the same polars image, and the same
`amber.py -g ... -l ... -o ... --skip_gs` in the same AMBER image, so the two arms'
`results.tsv` and `metrics_per_bin.tsv` are comparable by construction instead of by
inspection.

What makes scoring the reference arm possible at all: this campaign does not score bins
against CAMI's published `binning_gs.tsv`, whose SEQUENCEID column keys on the
CAMI-provided gold-standard assembly and shares no id space with any assembly we or
nf-core produce. It scores through the read-truth bridge, which joins reads-to-contigs
against reads-to-genomes and is therefore ASSEMBLY-AGNOSTIC. It votes over nf-core's
contigs exactly as it votes over ours.

Usage, one sample at a time:

    score_reference_amber.py \\
        --sample-id marine_sample_0 \\
        --assembly   <outdir>/Assembly/MEGAHIT/MEGAHIT-marine_sample_0.contigs.fa.gz \\
        --bam        <bam of that sample's reads against THAT assembly> \\
        --reads-mapping <cami>/.../marine_sample_0_reads/reads_mapping.tsv.gz \\
        --nfcore-contig-to-bin <outdir>/GenomeBinning/contig_to_bin/contig_to_bin_map.tsv \\
        --outdir /scratch/phyberos/reference_amber/marine_sample_0

CAUTION the assembly basename carries the assembler as a PREFIX --
`MEGAHIT-<sample>.contigs.fa.gz`, not `<sample>.contigs.fa.gz`. Verified against a real
rung-1 outdir, and getting it wrong reads as an absent file rather than a wrong one.

For the reference arm prefer `--nfcore-contig-to-bin`: nf-core/mag publishes ONE
four-column map for every binner (`mag.nf:467`, via `storeDir`, unconditionally), and
this script splits it into one AMBER label per `binner` value. `--contig-to-bin
LABEL=PATH` is for a two-column table -- our own arm's, or a hand-made one -- and it
now REFUSES a wider file rather than guessing, because the membership discriminator
only ever inspects two columns and would otherwise take `assembly_id` as the bin and
score every contig into one bin.

WARNING the BAM must be the sample's reads aligned against ITS OWN assembly, which is
what `binning_map_mode = 'own'` produces. A cross-mapped BAM names contigs from another
sample's assembly, the read-to-contig table then joins against the wrong contig set, and
the vote silently scores a different assembly. The script asserts the overlap rather
than trusting the filename.

CAUTION the column layout of nf-core/mag's own `contig_to_bin` tables was UNVERIFIED when
this was written. Rather than guess it, `_read_contig_to_bin` discriminates the contig
column by testing which column's values actually occur in the assembly, and fails loudly
if neither does. That check is worth keeping even once the layout is known: it is also
what catches a BAM or a table belonging to a different sample.
